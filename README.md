# Interview Test Project - ASP.NET

## Overview

This project implements a basic ASP.NET Core application. The functionality includes [briefly describe the feature of the app, e.g., a REST API to manage users or tasks, etc.]. The objective of this test is to showcase the ability to build scalable, maintainable solutions using ASP.NET Core.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or later)
- SQL Server (or another database engine, as per the task requirements)
- IDE such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code

## Project Structure

- **Controllers**: Contains API controllers for each resource.
- **Models**: Data models used throughout the app.
- **Data**: Database context and migrations (if using Entity Framework).
- **Services**: Contains business logic and service layer.
- **Migrations**: For Entity Framework migrations (if used).
- **appsettings.json**: Configuration file for database connection strings and other settings.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command to restore the required NuGet packages:

```
dotnet restore
```
### 3. Configure Database Connection

Open the `appsettings.json` file and update the connection string for your database:

```
{
"ConnectionStrings": {
"DefaultConnection": "Server=<your-server>;Database=<your-database>;User Id=<your-username>;Password=<your-password>;"
}
}
```

### 4. Apply Migrations (if applicable)

If using Entity Framework Core for database management, run the following command to apply any migrations:

```
dotnet ef database update
```

### 5. Run the Application

Now, you can run the application locally:

```
dotnet run
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:<port>`.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

If the project includes unit tests, you can run them with the following command:

```
dotnet test
```

This will run all the tests in the solution and display the results.

### API Testing

If the project is an API, you can use Postman or cURL to test the API routes.

#### Example API Routes

- **GET /api/resources**: Retrieves a list of resources.
- **POST /api/resources**: Creates a new resource.
- **PUT /api/resources/{id}**: Updates an existing resource.
- **DELETE /api/resources/{id}**: Deletes a resource.

For example, to get the list of resources:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:<port>/api/resources
```

### Manual Testing (if applicable)

If the project includes a frontend or UI, you can open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:<port>` to interact with the interface.

## Submission Instructions

1. Commit your changes:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Completed interview test project"
git push origin main
```

2. Submit the GitHub repository link to [email/other submission method].

## Notes
